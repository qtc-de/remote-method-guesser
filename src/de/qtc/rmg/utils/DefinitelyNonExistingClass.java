/**
 * This class can be considered as a leftover. It was once used to determine the useCodebaseOnly
 * setting of RMI servers, but this is now done via malformed URLs within class annotations. The
 * class is still used in one DGC function (although it is not really required there), but could
 * theoretically be removed. We leave it for now, as it may be useful for future development.
 *
 * The initial idea of the class was just to have a default object that can be sent to server, that
 * is certainly not available within the server's class path.
