/**
 * The PortScanner class implements a simple RMI service scan that can be used to
 * identify RMI endpoints on a target. By default, it takes a list of ports from the
 * remote-method-guesser configuration file and attempts to perform an RMI call on
 * them. Calls are first dispatched without TLS, but for each port that is open and
 * that does not behave like an RMI port for plain text connections, a second attempt
 * with TLS is made.
 *
 * The PortScanner class is not meant to be used as a replacement for tools like nmap.
 * It is e.g. less reliable, as it does not implement retries and may misses some open
 * ports. However, it can still be useful in certain situations. A common scenario is,
 * that you encounter a product that is often deployed together with RMI services like
 * e.g. JBoss. Or that you already encountered a non registry RMI port and just want
 * to know where the registry is located. In these cases, a quick port scan that only
 * targets common RMI ports using RMI service probes might be a good choice.
 *
 * Concerning TLS protected ports, the PortScanner class might even be more reliable
 * than nmap regarding the service detection. In the past, we encountered several TLS
 * protected RMI ports where nmap was unable to detect the service correctly.
