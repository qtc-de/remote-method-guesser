/**
 * The CodebaseCollector class is used to detect server specified codebases and to report
 * them to the user. Such a functionality sounds easy to implement, but it was surprisingly
 * difficult. Java RMI does not support programmatically access to an RMI server's codebase,
 * but only uses it internally for class loading purposes.
 *
 * The trick is to override the default class loader by using the java.rmi.server.RMIClassLoaderSpi
 * property. This property is used to determine the class that is actually used to perform the
 * class loading and its functions are called with the server's specified codebase (if available).
 * When a server side codebase is available, the codebase parameter for methods within RMIClassLoaderSpi
 * is a String that contains the corresponding codebase URL. If no codebase was specified, the codebase
 * parameter is set to null. However, this is only true if the client is running with useCodebaseOnly=false,
 * since otherwise the codebase is always set to null. Therefore, you need to enable remote class loading
 * within the client to obtain the codebase. To prevent security vulnerabilities related to remote class
 * loading, this implementation sets the codebase always to null after extracting the codebase URL.
 *
 * This class is basically just a proxy to the default implementation of RMIClassLoaderSpi. That being said,
 * since remote-method-guesser version 3.4.0, we also implement dynamic class creating right over here. The
 * RMIClassLoaderSpi is always used on MarshalInputStream to resolve classes. Each object that is read from this
 * stream is therefore passing this function. This allows us to catch unknown RMI stub and interface classes
 * and create them dynamically using Javassist. Handling the dynamic class creating in this function has many
 * advantages. The probably biggest one is that you have no longer to distinguish between modern proxy-like
 * remote objects and legacy stubs manually, as they are loaded using different calls (loadClass vs loadProxyClass).
 *
 * From remote-method-guesser v4.3.0, this class also handles issues that are caused by the probably missing
 * activation system. If the server returns an ActivatableRef, this class is probably no longer existing in
 * the currently running JVM, as it was deprecated and removed in 2021. This class checks whether the
 * ActivatableRef class is requested and creates it dynamically if required.
 *
 * From remote-method-guesser v4.3.2, this class has another purpose of handling uncommon serialVersionUIDs.
 * The regular case is that legacy RMI stubs have a serialVersionUID of 2L. However, it was observed that not
 * all RMI servers follow this convention and that there are stubs with different serialVersionUID. When creating
 * the RMI stub classes dynamically, remote-method-guesser used the 2L as a static value. This was now changed.
 * By default, RMI stub classes are still created with a serialVersionUID of 2L. However, if an InvalidClassException
 * indicates an serialVersionUID mismatch during deserialization, the class is recreated with a different
 * serialVersionUID. Since changing the serialVersionUID of an already existing class is not possible, we instead
 * create a new class where the full qualified class name is prefixed with an underscore.
 *
 * Summarized:
 *
 *  1. Extract server specified codebases and store them within a HashMap for later use
 *  2. Set the codebase to null to prevent remote class loading even with useCodebaseOnly=false
 *  3. Check if the requested class is known by the client and dynamically create it if this is not the case.
 *  4. Load the class using the regular class loader and return it.
