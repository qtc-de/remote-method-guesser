/**
 * Socket implementation that prevents outputs from being sent anywhere and that simulates input
 * by using a byte array that is set when calling the constructor. This socket is used for the
 * --ssrf-response option, where no real network interaction is desired and where the server response
 * is already present in form of a byte array.
 *
 * Due to the nature of ssrf, the SSRFResponseSocket is a single use socket. It is expected to contain
 * the information for one particular remote-method-guesser action. When using e.g. the default enum
 * action with --ssrf-response, the socket is expected to only contain information for the 'list' action.
 * If other actions are desired, they have to be specified explicitly. Multiple actions within a single
 * ssrf operation are not supported.
 *
 * remote-method-guesser attempts to shutdown itself after a single operation was executed with --ssrf-response.
 * As a fallback, the SSRFResponseSocket terminates the program if it is used for multiple actions. This is
 * implemented by a count that tracks how often the OutputStream was used.
 *
 * Notice that the count needs to be implemented on the object level. When using a static count for the class,
 * you get into trouble with the 'lookup' action. During a lookup, a LiveRef is read from the network. This
 * causes the 'read' function of the LiveRef class to trigger, which sends a DGCAck to the obtained remote
 * object. Therefore, performing a lookup causes two SSRFResponseSockets to be created and one InputStream and
 * OutputStream is used on both of them.
