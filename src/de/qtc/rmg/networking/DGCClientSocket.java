/**
 * The DGCClientSocket simulates a connection to the DGC server side component of a remote object.
 * All output that is written to the socket is dropped. When input is read from the socket, it
 * returns a static DGC response that contains an invalid class (an Integer that violates the DGC
 * deserialization filter). The standard behavior for the DGC is to give up on DGC calls when an
 * invalid class is encountered. An alternative is to return a long living Lease.
 *
 * Currently where is only one use case in remote-method-guesser for this class that should create
 * at maximum one DGC connection per remote endpoint. The implementation in this class is not suitable
 * for connection reuse. If connections are reused, the DGC will encounter errors, since the static
 * response always contains a full RMI handshake. In the current state this should never occur and even
 * if it occurs, it shouldn't impact the user experience as DGC exceptions are handled hidden from the
 * user. If reuse of connections is required in future, you may want to add a more sophisticated connection
 * handling in this class, which checks whether a connection is newly created or being reused.
